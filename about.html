                        Julio grew up in California (not the beautiful beach California everybody dreams of but a small
                        5,000 population cow üêÑtown).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="indent">
                        Julio receieved his bachelors from the University of California Davis with a Major in Managerial Economics and
                        two minors in Applied Computing Information Systems and Statistics.

                        Julio's experiences include being a summer camp counselor for 2 summers (someone had to teach these youngins the
                        way
                        of life), supervisor in the agricultural field (where I once came eye to eye with a coyote in the middle of the
                        night),
                        fellow at the Sacramento Entrepreneurship Academy (all those shark tank episodes
                        finally had paid off), financial intern at Morgan Stanley (where I learned the secret art of the stock market:
                        buy
                        low
                        sell high),
                        risk management intern at the Federal Deposit Insurance
                        Corporation (finally figured out what the acronym FDIC at the bank stood for), and financial intern Goldman
                        Sachs (10 weeks and 7 projects later received an offer).

                        Julio has now been with Goldman Sachs for 3 years and also a current student of the University of Utah Coding
                        Bootcamp.
